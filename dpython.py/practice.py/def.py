def solve(a,b):
    return b if a==0 else solve(b% a ,a)
print(solve(20,50))
"""
Sure! Let's break down the code and explain its logic in detail.

### Code:

```python
def solve(a, b):
    return b if a == 0 else solve(b % a, a)

print(solve(20, 50))
```

This code is implementing a version of **Euclid's Algorithm** to compute the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two numbers `a` and `b`. The function `solve(a, b)` works recursively.

### Steps:

1. **Base case**:
   - The function checks if `a == 0`. If this is true, it returns `b` because the GCD of 0 and any number `b` is `b`. This is the termination condition for the recursion.

2. **Recursive case**:
   - If `a` is not zero, the function makes a recursive call to `solve(b % a, a)`, where `b % a` is the remainder when `b` is divided by `a`.
   - The Euclidean algorithm relies on the property that:
     \[
     \text{GCD}(a, b) = \text{GCD}(b \% a, a)
     \]
     This means that the GCD of two numbers is the same as the GCD of the remainder and the smaller of the two numbers.

### Detailed Breakdown:

1. **First call: `solve(20, 50)`**
   - `a = 20` and `b = 50`.
   - Since `a != 0`, the function proceeds to the recursive case.
   - We compute `b % a = 50 % 20 = 10`.
   - The recursive call is made: `solve(10, 20)`.

2. **Second call: `solve(10, 20)`**
   - `a = 10` and `b = 20`.
   - Again, `a != 0`, so the function proceeds to the recursive case.
   - We compute `b % a = 20 % 10 = 0`.
   - The recursive call is made: `solve(0, 10)`.

3. **Third call: `solve(0, 10)`**
   - `a = 0` and `b = 10`.
   - This time, since `a == 0`, the base case is triggered, and the function returns `b`, which is 10.

### Key Concept: **Euclidean Algorithm**
- The Euclidean algorithm is a well-known method to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The algorithm works as follows:
  1. Divide `b` by `a` to get the remainder `r` (i.e., `r = b % a`).
  2. Replace `b` with `a` and `a` with `r`.
  3. Repeat this process until `a` becomes 0. The non-zero value of `b` at that point is the GCD.

### Execution Flow:

- **First call**: `solve(20, 50)`
  - `b % a = 50 % 20 = 10`
  - Calls `solve(10, 20)`

- **Second call**: `solve(10, 20)`
  - `b % a = 20 % 10 = 0`
  - Calls `solve(0, 10)`

- **Third call**: `solve(0, 10)`
  - Base case reached, returns `b = 10`.

### Conclusion:

The GCD of 20 and 50 is 10. Therefore, the output of `print(solve(20, 50))` is:

```
10
```

### Recursion in the Code:
This implementation uses recursion, meaning the function calls itself with updated arguments (`b % a` and `a`) until it reaches the base case where `a == 0`. Once it reaches the base case, the recursion "unwinds," returning the GCD to the original caller.

This method is efficient because each recursive step reduces the size of the problem by taking the remainder (`b % a`), which typically leads to a much smaller value for `b` in the next recursive step.
